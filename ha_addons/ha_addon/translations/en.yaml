  inverters:
    name: Inverters
    description: >+
      For each GEN3 inverter, the serial number of the inverter must be mapped to an MQTT
      definition. To do this, the corresponding configuration block is started with
      16-digit serial number so that all subsequent parameters are assigned
      to this inverter. Further inverter-specific parameters (e.g. polling mode) can be set
      in the configuration block

      The serial numbers of all GEN3 inverters start with `R17` and that of the GEN3PLUS
      inverters with ‘Y17’ or ‘47’!
      
      For reference see example configuration in Documentation Tab

  tsun.enabled:
    name: Connection to TSUN Cloud - for GEN3 inverter only
    description: >+
      switch on/off connection to the TSUN cloud.
      This connection is only required if you want send data to the TSUN cloud
      eg. to use the TSUN APPs or receive firmware updates.
      
      on => normal proxy operation.
      off => The Inverter become isolated from Internet.
  solarman.enabled:
    name: Connection to Solarman Cloud - for GEN3PLUS inverter only
    description: >+
      switch on/off connection to the Solarman cloud.
      This connection is only required if you want send data to the Solarman cloud
      eg. to use the Solarman APPs or receive firmware updates.
      
      on => normal proxy operation.
      off => The Inverter become isolated from Internet
  inverters.allow_all:
    name: Allow all connections from all inverters
    description: >-
      The proxy only usually accepts connections from configured inverters.
      Switch on for test purposes and unknown serial numbers.
